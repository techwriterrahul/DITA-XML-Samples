    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This topic provides information about the different stages that the Zipper service goes through to perform zipping and unzipping of files.</p>
        <p class="p">The service does zipping and unzipping automatically based on the parameters given in the configuration file. However, in each operation, the service reads a different set of parameters and works in the order defined below.</p>
        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Stages in zipping</h2>
            
            <p class="p">In the zipping operation, the service receives its input from the parameters that are defined in the <strong class="ph b">Zipping Values</strong> section of the configuration file. The zipping operation happens in the following order.</p>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">Firstly, the service searches for the trigger file in the source directory.<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">TriggerFile</strong> parameter in the configuration file specifies the type of the trigger file by defining its extension, such as .oxi, .ocx, etc.</p></li>
                <li class="li">Secondly, the service compresses files that are available in the source directory into a zip file and then places the zip file in the destination directory.</li>
                <li class="li">At last the service deletes the source files and the trigger file from the source folder.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="p">In the unzipping operation, the service receives its input from the parameters that are defined in the <strong class="ph b">Unzipping Values</strong> section of the configuration file. The unzipping operation happens in the following order.</p>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li class="li">Firstly, the service picks a file for unzipping from the directory specified in the <strong class="ph b">UnzipFomPath</strong> parameter.</li>
